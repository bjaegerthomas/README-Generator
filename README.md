  ## Description
  This program will allow a user to easily generate a basic README markdown file for their future or current projects.

  ## Installation
  Installation is simple as all you will need to do is clone the repository to your own local drive.

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/README-Generator.git

  There will be a README.md file in the folder directory explaining this project as well as an additional README.md sample file in the dist folder.
  Once you initiate the program and run it, your README.md file will overwrite the sample file in the dist folder.

  ## Usage
  In order to run the program you will need to navigate to the README-Generator project directory.
  In the terminal type the following: 
  
  node index.js

  Then hit return.

  Next the program will ask you a series of questions to help populate the different areas of your README file with pertinent information. Hit return after each entry.

  First you will need to enter the title of your README file:

  [](./assets/title.png)

  Next you will need to enter a description of what your project does:

  [](./assets/description.png)

  After that you will be asked to enter installation instructions:

  [](./assets/installation.png)

  Then you will be asked to provide usage information:

  [](./assets/usage.png)

  Next you will be asked to provide contribution guidelines:

  [](./assets/contribution.png)

  After that you will be asked for test instructions:

  [](./assets/test.png)

  Next it will ask for your github username:

  [](./assets/github.png)

  It will then ask for your email address:

  [](./assets/email.png)

  And finally you will be asked to choose a license for your project.
  Using the arrow keys you can navigate to the choice best suited for
  your project and hit enter to select your choice:

  [](./assets/license.png)

  You should then see the following message:

  [](./assets/message.png)

  As well as a README file in the dist folder with the following template look:

  [](./assets/sample.png)

  Remember this a simple README.md file generator and you can always go back and fine tune it to meet your needs once it is created.
  This program will give you a head start and provide a basic layout to get you started and save some time on your project.

  ## Contribution
  After cloning the repository be sure to create a new branch for your feature or fix.
  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
  Submit a Pull Request with clear explanations of your modifications.
  Use meaningful variable names and comments.
  Follow guidelines for Javascript code formatting.

  ## Tests
  Above in the Usage area you can see a series of screenshots indicating sample test entries as well as a sample README file which has
  been outputted to the dist folder. All of the questions will accept string value entries except for the last one which asks you to choose a liicense form a series of choices.
